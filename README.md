# Color-War
Trying to make "Color Wars" from "1 2 3 4 Player Games"

No animations because i can't <br>
Best played on tablets

Download "1 2 3 4 Player Games" because it looks way better <br>
But if you still want it from me

<h1>How to Play:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Place Tile on Empty space in First Round</li>
  <li>Increase Tile Value by clicking on it</li>
  <li>If the value gets to 4 it explodes an spreads on Tiles around it</li>
  <li>The tiles become yours an get value +1</li>
  <li>If the tiles already has value it just adds up</li>
  <li>If a tile explodes it also leaves empty space</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Install:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Download .html .js .css</li>
  <li>Put them in the same folder</li>
  <li>Open .html in your Browser</li>
</ol>
